# Migration Tool for Magento Commerce to Magento OpenSource

> Also known as Magento Enterprise (EE) to Magento Community (CE).

This migrating tool allows to downgrade the database schema without altering the data. The major difference between the
two editions are the `staging` definitions that enable draft and scheduled publication. Beside that the scripts provided
by the tool will remove some specific tables and attributes of the Magento Commerce Edition. It will also o my keep the latest version available for product and categories in staging.

**NOTICE**
- This tool has been initially developed for Magento Commerce 2.2.* version.
- This tool has not been tested with a split database configuration.
- Looking #6 it seems that the tool is working also with Magento Commerces 2.4.*
